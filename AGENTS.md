# CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW

## RESPONSES

- Keep responses concise and to the point - unless the user asks otherwise

## PLANNING MODE

- Always ask clarifying questions
- Never assume design, tech stack or features
- Use deep-dive sub-agents to assist with research
- Use deep-dive sub-agents to review the different aspects of your plan before presenting to the user
- Create a plan with clear steps and deliverables, and save it in the .agents/plans directory for future reference and
  implementation

## CHANGE / EDIT MODE

- Never implement features yourself when possible - use sub-agents!
- Identify changes from the plan that can be implemented in parallel, and use sub-agents to implement the features
  efficiently
- When using sub-agents to implement features, act as a coordinator only
- After completing features (large or small), always run commands like lint, type check and next build to check code
  quality

## TESTING

- Use any testing tools, libraries available to the project for testing your changes
- Never assume your changes simply work, always test!
