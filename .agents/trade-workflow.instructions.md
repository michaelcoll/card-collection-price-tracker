# Trade Workflow

## Overview

Card-for-card trade between exactly 2 users. Value differences are settled in cash outside the platform. Ratings are
optional and mutual.

## Actors

| Actor              | Role                                               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Initiator (A)**  | Finds a card and requests the trade                |
| **Respondent (B)** | Owner of the requested card, makes a counter-offer |

---

## Full Flow

### 1. Discovery

- User *A* searches for a card by name.
- *A* finds a card owned by user B.

### 2. Trade Request (status: `PENDING`)

- *A* sends a trade request for B's card.
- No card from *A* is proposed yet — *A* is simply saying "I want this card."
- *B* receives a notification: **"New trade request received."**

### 3. Counter-Proposal

- *B* browses *A*'s collection and selects 0 or more cards they're interested in, in exchange.
- The interface computes the value difference and displays the cash amount owed by one party to the other.
- *B* submits the counter-proposal. The trade then lists:
    - Cards offered by *B* → to *A*
    - Cards offered by *A* → to *B* (selected by B, or none)
    - Cash delta (informational only — settled outside the platform)
- *A* receives a notification: **"*B* made a counter-proposal."**

### 4. Negotiation (`PENDING`)

- Either party can modify the trade (add/remove cards, adjust) at any time **while the status is
  `PENDING`**.
- Each modification triggers a notification to the other party.

### 5. First Acceptance (status: `ONE_ACCEPTED`)

- One party clicks "Accept."
- A modal warns: **"Once accepted, the trade will be locked. If the other party modifies the trade, it will go back to
  pending and will need to be accepted again."**
- On confirmation:
    - Status → `ONE_ACCEPTED`.
    - All cards on both sides of the trade are **reserved** (visible in each user's collection).
    - Any other `PENDING` or `ONE_ACCEPTED` trades involving these same cards are automatically **abandoned**.
    - The affected parties receive a notification: **"A trade involving one of your reserved cards was finalized by
      another trade. Your trade has been cancelled."**
    - The other party receives a notification: **"Your partner accepted. Accept in turn or modify the trade to restart
      the negotiation."**

### 5b. Modification After Acceptance (back to `PENDING`)

- If either party modifies the trade while the status is `ONE_ACCEPTED`:
    - Status → `PENDING`.
    - Reserved cards are **released**.
    - Both previous acceptances are cancelled — both parties will need to accept again.
    - The other party receives a notification: **"The trade was modified. It is back in negotiation."**

### 6. Full Acceptance (status: `FULLY_ACCEPTED`)

- The second party accepts (same warning modal).
- Status → `FULLY_ACCEPTED`.
- Both parties receive a notification: **"Both parties have accepted. Proceed with the physical exchange."**

### 7. Physical Exchange

- The cards (and cash, if applicable) are exchanged in person, outside the platform.

### 8. Trade Confirmation (status: `COMPLETED`)

- Each party confirms "Trade completed" in the app.
- Status → `COMPLETED` once **both** have confirmed.
- Both parties receive a notification: **"Trade confirmed by both parties."**

### 9. Rating (optional, status: `CLOSED`)

- Each party can rate the other from 0 to 5 stars.
- Rating is optional — skipping it does not block closing.
- Once both have rated (or skipped), status → `CLOSED`.

## Card Reservation Rules

- Cards are reserved at the `ONE_ACCEPTED` step.
- A reserved card is shown as such in its owner's collection (badge or indicator).
- If the same card appears in several simultaneous trades:
    - The **first trade to reach `ONE_ACCEPTED`** reserves the card.
    - All other trades involving that card are automatically `ABANDONED`.
    - All affected parties are notified immediately.

## Modification Rules

| Who can modify | When                              | Effect on status                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Either party   | Status `PENDING`                  | Stays `PENDING`                        |
| Either party   | Status `ONE_ACCEPTED`             | Goes back to `PENDING`, cards released |
| No one         | Status `FULLY_ACCEPTED` or beyond | Not possible                           |

Any modification notifies the other party.

---

## Abandonment Rules

- Either party can abandon the trade at any time before `COMPLETED`.
- On abandonment:
    - Status → `ABANDONED`.
    - Reserved cards (if any) are released.
    - The other party receives a notification: **"The trade was abandoned by your partner."**
    - The abandoning party can be rated by the other party (optional, 0–5 stars).

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Online payment — the cash delta is informational only.
- Trade expiration — trades remain active indefinitely until accepted or abandoned.
- Trade history — planned post-MVP.
- Built-in messaging — may be added if deemed necessary.
